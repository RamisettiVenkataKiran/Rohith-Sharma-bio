        Rohit Gurunath Sharma, affectionately known as the “Hitman,” is one of the most naturally gifted and explosive opening batsmen in cricketing history. Born on April 30, 1987, in Nagpur and raised in Borivali, Mumbai, Rohit’s rise from a humble background to becoming one of India’s greatest modern cricketers is a remarkable journey of patience, resilience, and exceptional talent. He made his international debut in 2007 during the ICC T20 World Cup, where his calm unbeaten 50 against South Africa instantly showcased his maturity and big-match temperament.
        <br><br>
        For several years, Rohit played as a middle-order batsman, showing glimpses of brilliance but struggling to find consistency. Everything changed in 2013 when he was promoted as an opener — a career-transforming decision that unlocked a new era in world cricket. Rohit embraced the role with authority, becoming one of the most dominant ODI batsmen of his generation. His effortless stroke play, unmatched timing, and ability to go big allowed him to score not one but **three ODI double centuries**, including the world-record **264**, a knock etched forever in cricket folklore.
        <br><br>
        In the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup, Rohit shattered records by scoring **five centuries**, the most by any player in a single edition. His growth continued in Test cricket, where he reinvented himself as an opener, scoring twin centuries in his first Test as an opener in 2019. His calm demeanor, leadership qualities, and extraordinary batting achievements eventually led him to become India’s full-time captain across all formats, guiding the team to major series victories. Rohit’s career is a perfect blend of elegance, power, and consistency, making him one of the most influential players in modern cricket.

        Rohit Sharma’s franchise career, especially in the Indian Premier League (IPL), is legendary and directly associated with the success of the Mumbai Indians (MI). He began his IPL journey with the Deccan Chargers in 2008 and played a crucial role in their 2009 championship-winning season, including a memorable hat-trick. However, his true rise as a franchise cricket icon began in 2011 when he joined Mumbai Indians.
        <br><br>
        In 2013, Rohit was appointed captain of MI — a turning point that changed IPL history forever. Under his leadership, Mumbai Indians became the most dominant and consistent franchise, winning **five IPL titles** (2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2020). Rohit’s captaincy was marked by calmness, trust in young talent, sharp tactical decisions, and outstanding game awareness. He built a powerhouse squad that included future superstars like Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya, Pandya brothers, and Suryakumar Yadav.

        His ability to remain composed in high-pressure playoff matches, his instinctive field placements, and his leadership during tough phases turned MI into a dynasty.
